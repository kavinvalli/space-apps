Current resources for the ISS are scattered across multiple official websites, and it makes it tedious to learn about the ISS's innovations and the like for any casual enthusiast--given how incredible the ISS is, technologically and in international cooperation, such barriers shouldn't exist. Our product 'Liberty' alludes to the ISS's origins as space station Freedom: we aim to make learning about the accessible far more accessible. We offer a speedy web application which can be run on any device, even with internet disconnected. Liberty allows users to learn more about the past and present of ISS, and track the ISS passing over their heads, which makes it feel real and is very cool.
